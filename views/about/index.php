	The feature which is known as the confidence bar let's you to express your 
	confidence level for the uploaded sample answers since there can be errors </p> 
	<p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book"></span> Coursemash will be always upto date since everyone can upload their own answers
	and express their confidence levels for each and every upload. There will be no 
	delay for uploading since admins don't approve the uploads. </p>
	<p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book"></span> Mutual respect plays 
	a great role . So it would be great if you can express your confidence level precisely</p>
